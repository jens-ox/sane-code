# Sane Code

Run `npx sane-code` in your repo to check for things like

- JSON Schema validity of your `package.json`
- subjective code smells like `@types/*` in `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies`

Feel free to open issues if you have suggestions for more checks :relaxed:

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Add some checks
3. Run `npm run start` to run the checks on the `sane-code` repo itself
